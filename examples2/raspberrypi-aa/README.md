# Introduction to Raspberry Pi

An introductory course held at the [Artisan's Asylum](http://artisansasylum.com) that uses the increasingly popular credit-card sized computer named the Raspberry Pi in conjunction with the open source programming language Python to teach the basics of a variety of topics from electronics to web servers.

This repository holds the source code used in the class. The course website is hosted by GitHub at [raspberrypi-aa.github.io](http://raspberrypi-aa.github.io).
